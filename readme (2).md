# WhichCam
### It's an application for storing, showing, and visiting camera detail website !


## Pages

- Login page 
- Main page (Gallery, upload, signout)
- Web view page 


## Issues

From the beggining when I started to build this application I tried multiple ways to create a login page with an authentication but I wasn't able to pass the data to the next page, so I did it with no authentication after that. Next issue was with the second page which it was SecondActivity at first and it was Uploading the images to the Firestore but in a different way, so the issue with that was I couldn't pass the images to the Recyclerview for the showing part, I used the different tutorial to do it with the Real-time database.


## Is it working?
Other than my app is a simple image storage and a gallery overall it is working properly, and it has no bug until I submitted it.
### Configuration needed?
No configurations needed prior starting working with it.

### My codes
Login and web view pages was all my codes and I tried different ways to do that which the java and the xml files are still in my project.

# Working in a Group
I was working alone, so I did all of the project on my own.
